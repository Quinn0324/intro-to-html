            <p>	
            My name is Preston Quinn. I love learning and trying to figure out new things. Whether it is school-related or    something else like food or extreme sports I am always wanting to try things out and learn about things and myself.
            One of my passions is playing video games as I do quite a lot of in my free time and have been playing them since I was young around the age of 11. they are something I truley have a passion for and love to do.
